        <h2>Animal Safety During Driving</h2>
        <p>When driving, it's essential to be aware of the safety of animals, both wild and domestic. Every year, countless animals are injured or killed due to road accidents. By taking a few precautions, we can make roads safer for both animals and humans.</p>

        <h3>1. Be Alert in Rural and Forested Areas</h3>
        <p>Wild animals often cross roads in rural or forested areas. Pay close attention to road signs indicating animal crossings and reduce your speed when driving through these areas. At night, use your high beams (if possible) to spot animals early.</p>

        <h3>2. Avoid Sudden Swerves</h3>
        <p>If an animal suddenly appears in front of your vehicle, swerving may cause you to lose control. Instead, brake firmly while keeping the vehicle steady. It's safer to hit a small animal than risk a serious accident by swerving into oncoming traffic or off the road.</p>

        <h3>3. Secure Pets Properly</h3>
        <p>If you're traveling with pets, make sure they are safely secured in the vehicle. Use seat belts, carriers, or crates to prevent them from moving around while you're driving. Unsecured pets can distract the driver or even cause accidents.</p>

        <h3>4. Report Injured Animals</h3>
        <p>If you accidentally hit an animal or spot an injured one on the road, it's crucial to report it. Contact local animal control services or a wildlife rescue center to help injured animals get the care they need.</p>

        <h3>5. Slow Down and Stay Vigilant</h3>
        <div class="image-section">
            <p>Driving slower in areas where animals are likely to be present can give you more time to react. Always be vigilant, especially during dawn and dusk when animals are more active. By driving cautiously, you can help prevent accidents and ensure the safety of animals and yourself.</p>
